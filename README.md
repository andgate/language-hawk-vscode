# Hawk Language support

Support for the Hawk programming language in visual studio code.

## Highlighting

Adds highlighting support for Hawk (.hk).
This is a (now heavily) modified version of the syntax file from the [Haskell TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/haskell.tmbundle).

Also adds automatic indentation after `where`, `do`, `->` etc. and surrounding brackets (`[]`, `{}` etc)
